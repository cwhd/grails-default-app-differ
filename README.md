# Grails Default App Differ

Have you ever wondered what the difference between the autogenerated app is between different versions of Grails?  Now you don't have to!  This project has all that info for you.  What is here?:
 
- A bash script (doit.sh) that uses [GVM](http://gvmtool.net/) to pull down versions of Grails, create a default app, and check the differences into Git.
- The output of the script.  If you look through the history here you can see the diffs between sequential versions.  You can also use the power of Git to diff non-sequential versions if you like.

That's it, nice and simple.  Enjoy!
